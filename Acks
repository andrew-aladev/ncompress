Acknowledgments:

Compress, Version 4.1

Pat Myrto (rwing!pat@cs.washington.edu) deserves the credit
for undoing all the damage I did to this version with respect
to System V and for giving me the occasional kick when my
changes clobbered some necessary functionality.

Thanks to James A. Woods for permitting me to corrupt his baby
and for passing along some tips on ways to improve the performance
over 4.0.

Thanks to the previous authors whom I didn't contact, for making
the program available originally.
