Enclosed is a modified version of compress.c, along with scripts to make it
run identically to pack(1), unpack(1), an pcat(1).  Here is what I
(petsd!joe) and a colleague (petsd!peora!srd) did:

1. Removed VAX dependencies.
2. Changed the struct to separate arrays; saves mucho memory.
3. Did comparisons in unsigned, where possible.  (Faster on Perkin-Elmer.)
4. Sorted the character next chain and changed the search to stop
prematurely.  This saves a lot on the execution time when compressing.

This version is totally compatible with the original version.  Even though
lint(1) -p has no complaints about compress.c, it won't run on a 16-bit
machine, due to the size of the arrays.

Here is the README file from the original author:
 
>Well, with all this discussion about file compression (for news batching
>in particular) going around, I decided to implement the text compression
>algorithm described in the June Computer magazine.  The author claimed
>blinding speed and good compression ratios.  It's certainly faster than
>compact (but, then, what wouldn't be), but it's also the same speed as
>pack, and gets better compression than both of them.  On 350K bytes of
>unix-wizards, compact took about 8 minutes of CPU, pack took about 80
>seconds, and compress (herein) also took 80 seconds.  But, compact and
>pack got about 30% compression, whereas compress got over 50%.  So, I
>decided I had something, and that others might be interested, too.
>
>As is probably true of compact and pack (although I haven't checked),
>the byte order within a word is probably relevant here, but as long as
>you stay on a single machine type, you should be ok.  (Can anybody
>elucidate on this?)  There are a couple of asm's in the code (extv and
>insv instructions), so anyone porting it to another machine will have to
>deal with this anyway (and could probably make it compatible with Vax
>byte order at the same time).  Anyway, I've linted the code (both with
>and without -p), so it should run elsewhere.  Note the longs in the
>code, you can take these out if you reduce BITS to <= 15.

>Have fun, and as always, if you make good enhancements, or bug fixes,
>I'd like to see them.
